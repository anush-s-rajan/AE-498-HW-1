# AE-498-HW-1
MOID Calculation HW

This Python code first converts the orbital elements of each object into rotation matrices and orbital parameters to describe the orbit in three-dimensional space. It then sets up a system of equations based on the condition that the vector connecting the two orbits must be perpendicular to the tangent of each orbit at the points where the minimum distance occurs. To find these points, the code tests many initial guesses across a grid of true anomalies and uses a numerical solver (\texttt{scipy.optimize.root}) to locate all stationary points. It then calculates the distance between the orbits at each stationary point and selects the smallest distance as the MOID. Finally, the code converts this distance into kilometers and astronomical units and reports the true anomalies along each orbit where the minimum distance occurs.
